# AngryBirds
We are buliding an Angry Birds clone in Java, using libGDX.

- Github repo link: https://github.com/rishi23437/AngryBirds/edit/main
The repo is currently private. At the time of evaluation/demo, we will add the required Github id of the TA as collaborator.

- We have submitted a Zip file containing a folder(NAME THIS) which contains all the source code and assets related to the game, UML and UML Use Case diagrams, and this README file.
